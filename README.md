"Pseudo-manifolds in Haskell", short `pmfd-hs`, is the software i wrote
for my bachelor thesis. It's a library written in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) that
handles so called [pseudo-manifolds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomanifold) with a focus on closed surfaces
and 2-dimensional pseudo-manifolds. Its ultimate goal was to algorithmically
decide whether a given [loop](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FundamentalGroup.html) on a 2-dimensional pseudo-manifold
is null-homotopic (i.e. (pointed) homotopic to a constant loop).
